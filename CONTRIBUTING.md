# Contributing to üç¨Sugar

**Note:** This document is modified from [angular/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We would love for you to contribute to Sugar and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

<!-- - [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) -->
- [Question or Problem?](#got-a-question-or-problem)
- [Issues and Bugs](#found-a-bug)
- [Feature Requests](#missing-a-feature)
- [Submission Guidelines](#submission-guidelines)
- [Coding Rules](#coding-rules)
- [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-format)

<!-- ## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Sugar open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). -->

## Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. Instead, we recommend using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sugar) to ask support-related questions. When creating a new question on Stack Overflow, make sure to add the `sugar` tag.

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/Stanley5249/sugar/issues/new/choose) to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request-pr) with a fix.

## Missing a Feature?

You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/Stanley5249/sugar/issues/new/choose) to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request-pr).

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproduction. Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue templates](https://github.com/Stanley5249/sugar/issues/new/choose) and filling out the issue template.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.
2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add. Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.
3. Please sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending PRs. We cannot accept code without a signed CLA. Make sure you author all contributed Git commits with email address associated with your CLA signature.
4. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the Stanley5249/sugar repo.
5. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
    ```

6. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
7. Follow our [Coding Rules](#coding-rules).
8. Run the full test suite, and ensure that all tests pass.
9. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message conventions](#commit-message-format). Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

    ```shell
    git commit --all
    ```

10. Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

11. In GitHub, send a pull request to `Stanley5249:main`.

### Reviewing a Pull Request

The Sugar team reserves the right not to accept pull requests from community members who haven't been good citizens of the community.
<!-- Such behavior includes not following the [Sugar code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and applies within or outside of Sugar managed channels. -->

#### Addressing review feedback

If we ask for changes via code reviews then:

1. Make the required updates to the code.
2. Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
3. Create a fixup commit and push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git commit --all --fixup HEAD
    git push
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### Updating the commit message

A reviewer might often suggest changes to a commit message (for example, to add more context for a change or adhere to our [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-format)). In order to update the commit message of the last commit on your branch:

1. Check out your branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout my-fix-branch
    ```

2. Amend the last commit and modify the commit message:

    ```shell
    git commit --amend
    ```

3. Push to your GitHub repository:

    ```shell
    git push --force-with-lease
    ```

**NOTE:** If you need to update the commit message of an earlier commit, you can use `git rebase` in interactive mode. See the [git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode) for more details.

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

* Check out the main branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout main -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

* Update your local `main` with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream main
    ```

## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* All public API methods **must be documented**.
* We use [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting. To check for linting issues, run:

    ```sh
    ruff check .
    ```

## Commit Message Format

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted. This format leads to **easier to read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the [Commit Message Header](#commit-message-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except for those of type "docs". When the body is present it must be at least 20 characters long and must conform to the [Commit Message Body](#commit-message-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-message-footer) format describes what the footer is used for and the structure it must have.

### Commit Message Header

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ             ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ             ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ Commit Scope: core|cli|docs|tests|examples
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚´∏ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

#### Scope

The scope should be the name of the module/package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

#### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain _why_ you are making the change. You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate the impact of the change.

### Commit Message Footer

The footer can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations and is also the place to reference GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to. For example:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>

<breaking change description + migration instructions>

Fixes #<issue number>
```

or

```
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>

<deprecation description + recommended update path>

Closes #<pr number>
```

Breaking Change section should start with the phrase `BREAKING CHANGE: ` followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

Similarly, a Deprecation section should start with `DEPRECATED: ` followed by a short description of what is deprecated, a blank line, and a detailed description of the deprecation that also mentions the recommended update path.

### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
